/*
 Function prototype for reading a text file that defines an
 undetermined number of vectors. See assignment PDF for format of this
 file.
 
 Basic Step-by-Step instructions
  1. Open file using string value assigned to file_name character pointer.
     (can ONLY use open(), close(), and read())

  2. Determine the number of lines of input in the file.

  3. malloc() appropriate amount of space for the array of vectors.

  2. For each vector defined in the text file, read in the magnitude
     and direction values and then split using the comma character as
     the delimiter. There are many ways to do this, just remember a
     char pointer (i.e. char*) can be treated as a character array
     (i.e. file_name[0] will return the char value at index position
     0).  Don't forget to increment a counter variable that maintains
     number of vectors read-in by this function.

  3. Convert parsed magnitude and direction values to from a string to
     a double (hint: use atof() function)

  4. Store magnitude and direction double values in the correct index
     position in the v_struct array.  Hint: The position of the vector
     in the text file is equivalent to the index position in the
     v_struct array.

 NOTE:        You can ONLY use the open(), write(), and close() sys calls.

 Arguments:   char* file_name = file name of vector text file
	      p_vec_array_ptr = pointer to a pointer to an array of v_structs

 Return:      Number (int data type) of vectors read-in by function
              or -1 if an error

int read(char* file_name, v_struct** p_vec_array_ptr);
